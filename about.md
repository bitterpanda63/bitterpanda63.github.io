Hiya!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on 💜 [Zen by Aikido](https://github.com/AikidoSec/firewall-python) 💜, Also take a look at [Zen Internals](https://github.com/AikidoSec/zen-internals), our Rust library with vulnerability detection algorithms!
- 🌱 I’m currently developing my skills in: Bytecode Instrumentation, UDS Communication, Kernel Development, and more!
- 💬 AMA Using [Github Issues](https://github.com/bitterpanda63/bitterpanda63/issues)
- 💻 I've been developing both Aikido's **Python** and **Java** WAF (See [Zen by Aikido](https://github.com/AikidoSec/firewall-python)), And started our **Rust** FFI Library for better SQL Injection detection. I started my programming journey with **JavaScript/TypeScript** and used them a lot ever since.

xoxo Happy Coding!
