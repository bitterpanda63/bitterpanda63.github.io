title: My Terminal Window Titles Suck
order: 1
---

Honestly they are just not telling me what I want to know, The current directory and username already take up most of the space.

So I'm going to try and fix it, for fun. I discovered I can change the terminal window title easily by setting the env variable `PROMPT_COMMAND` to :
```sh
echo -ne "\033]0;My title here\007"
```
Which is awesome, but now we have to get a decent terminal title, for this I'm thinking we might want to use a local LLM. 
Obviously I'll be using Python so let's create a new project and install [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation) : 
```sh
mkdir termtiles && cd termtiles
poetry init
poetry add transformers
```

Continuing...
